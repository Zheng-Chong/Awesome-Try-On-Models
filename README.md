## What is Virtual Try-on (VTON) ?

Virtual Try-on (VTON) refers to the technology that allows users to try on clothing or accessories in a virtual environment, typically using generative models in AI. This technology digitally simulates how clothes, shoes, or accessories will look on a user without them physically wearing the items.

This repository primarily focuses on **image, video, and 3D-based try-on models published after 2023**, aiming to provide insights into the latest technological trends. 

**iThe project is ongoing, and we welcome contributions in any forms to help improve and expand it.**i

**iIf you're interested in VTON or find this repo helpful, please ðŸŒŸstar  and  ðŸ‘€ watch it !**
